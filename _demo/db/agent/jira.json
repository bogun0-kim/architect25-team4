It takes a natural language input, interprets the request, and uses internal MCP tools to execute the appropriate actions.\n* The agent is equipped with multiple tools and can autonomously choose the most suitable tool for the user's intent.\n* The `input` should be a plain English request describing what the user wants to know or compute.\n* The `context` field is optional and can include supplemental information from previous steps or system memory to improve accuracy.\n* The output is a final answer generated after the agent completes reasoning and tool execution.\n* You should not assume the agent knows everything; it only knows what its tools allow it to observe or compute.\n* Do not include multiple unrelated questions in a single input. The agent processes one task per request.",
