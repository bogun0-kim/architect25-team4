  "description": "weather_agent(input=\"input message for weather_agent\", context=\"context for weather_agent\") -> str:\n* This is a unified interface to a multi-tool agent. It takes a natural language input, interprets the request, and uses internal MCP tools to execute the appropriate actions.\n* The agent is equipped with multiple tools (e.g., math, weather queries, etc.) and can autonomously choose the most suitable tool for the user's intent.\n* The `input` should be a plain English request describing what the user wants to know or compute.\n* The `context` field is optional and can include supplemental information from previous steps or system memory to improve accuracy.\n* The output is a final answer generated after the agent completes reasoning and tool execution.\n* You should not assume the agent knows everything; it only knows what its tools allow it to observe or compute.\n* `Seoul` is the default location when a location parameter is not provided.\n* Do not include multiple unrelated questions in a single input. The agent processes one task per request.\n* DO NOT guess the current date when the user does not specify a date.\n* If a `date` parameter is required but not provided, you MUST call calendar agent first to obtain the date.",
