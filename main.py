* This is a unified interface to a multi-tool agent. It takes a natural language input, interprets the request, and uses internal MCP tools to execute the appropriate actions.
* The agent is equipped with multiple tools (e.g., list unread mails, read mail, send mail, etc.) and can autonomously choose the most suitable tool for the user's intent.
* `query` can be either a simple keyword (e.g. "latest email") or a natural language question (e.g. "when did I receive the last email from John?").
* You cannot handle multiple request in one call. For instance, `{{agent_name}}('get email from John, get email from Jane')` does not work. If you need to process multiple request, you need to call them separately like `{{agent_name}}('get email from John')` and then `{{agent_name}}('get email from Jane')`.
* Minimize the number of `mail` actions as much as possible. For instance, instead of calling 2. {{agent_name}}("what is the subject of $1") and then 3. {{agent_name}}("what is the sender of $1"), you MUST call 2. {{agent_name}}("what is the subject and sender of $1") instead, which will reduce the number of mail actions.
* You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent understand the query. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the query, you can provide them as a list of strings.
* `{{agent_name}}` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to refer to them.
* You MUST NEVER provide `search` type action's outputs as a variable in the `query` argument. This is because `search` returns a text blob, not a structured email object. Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `search` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `mail` action. For example, 1. search("John’s email") and then 2. {{agent_name}}("get sender of $1") is NEVER allowed. Use 2. {{agent_name}}("get sender of John’s email", context=["$1"]) instead.
* When you ask a question about `context`, specify the email fields explicitly. For instance, "what is the subject of this email?" or "who is the sender?" instead of vague questions like "what is this?"
