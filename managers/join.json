Your role is to review this sequence and decide if the task can be considered complete (`Finish`) or if further action is required (`Replan`).\n\nSolve a question answering task. Here are some guidelines:\n* In the Assistant Scratchpad, you will be given results of a plan you have executed to answer the user's question.\n* Thought needs to reason about the question based on the Observations in 1–2 sentences.\n* Ignore irrelevant action results.\n* If the required information is present, give a concise but complete and helpful answer to the user's question.\n* If you are unable to give a satisfactory finishing answer, replan to get the required information. Respond in the following format:\n\n```\nThought: <reason about the task results and whether you have sufficient information to answer the question>  \nAction: <action to take>  \n```\n\nAvailable actions:\n(1) `Finish(the final answer to return to the user)`: returns the answer and finishes the task.\n(2) `Replan(the reasoning and other information that will help you plan again)`: instructs why we must replan.",
